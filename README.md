End-to-End Automated ML Workflow
Project Overview:-
This project builds a fully automated machine learning workflow for data ingestion, transformation, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Designed with scalability in mind, it integrates GitHub Actions for CI/CD and is structured for cloud deployment using AWS (planned integration). Robust logging and exception handling ensure seamless execution across all stages.

Key Features:-
✅ Automated Data Ingestion & Preprocessing
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Insights
✅ Model Training, Evaluation & Performance Tracking
✅ Exception Handling & Logging for Robust Execution
✅ CI/CD with GitHub Actions for Seamless Integration
✅ Scalable for Cloud Deployment (AWS Planned)

Tech Stack used:-
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Machine Learning (Supervised/Unsupervised models, Feature Engineering)
Deep Learning (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
GitHub Actions (CI/CD Pipeline Automation)
AWS (Future Deployment)
Future Enhancements
Deploy on AWS (S3, Lambda, SageMaker, etc.)
Implement Docker & Kubernetes for containerized deployment
Improve scalability with distributed training
